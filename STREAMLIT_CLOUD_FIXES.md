# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Heavy Dependencies Removed
- **Removed**: `spacy==3.7.0` (too large, requires system dependencies)
- **Replaced with**: `nltk==3.8.1` (lightweight, no system dependencies)

### 2. Updated Requirements.txt
- Organized dependencies by category
- Removed problematic packages
- Added lightweight alternatives

### 3. Created packages.txt
- Added system dependencies for cryptography and audio processing
- Ensures proper installation of required system packages

### 4. Fixed Code Dependencies
- Updated `nlp_metrics.py` to use NLTK instead of spaCy
- Removed spaCy imports from `scoring.py`
- Maintained all functionality with lighter alternatives

## Files Modified

1. **requirements.txt** - Streamlined for Streamlit Cloud
2. **packages.txt** - New file for system dependencies
3. **nlp_metrics.py** - Replaced spaCy with NLTK
4. **scoring.py** - Removed spaCy import
5. **.streamlit/secrets.toml** - Template for configuration

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets
3. Add your actual API keys and configuration:
   ```toml
   aws_access_key_id = "your_actual_key"
   aws_secret_access_key = "your_actual_secret"
   openai_api_key = "your_openai_key"
   anthropic_api_key = "your_anthropic_key"
   ```

### 3. Redeploy
- Streamlit Cloud will automatically detect the changes
- The deployment should now succeed without the installer error

## Key Changes Made

### NLP Processing
- **Before**: Used spaCy (heavy, requires model downloads)
- **After**: Uses NLTK (lightweight, built-in models)
- **Impact**: Faster deployment, smaller package size

### Dependencies
- **Removed**: Heavy packages that cause timeouts
- **Added**: Lightweight alternatives
- **Result**: Faster installation, more reliable deployment

### Error Handling
- Added fallback mechanisms in NLP processing
- Graceful degradation if NLTK data isn't available
- Better error messages for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Logs**: Look at the detailed error logs in Streamlit Cloud
2. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured
3. **Test Locally**: Run `streamlit run app.py` locally to test changes
4. **Simplify Further**: Remove more dependencies if needed

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Usually caused by heavy packages
2. **Import Errors**: Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
3. **System Dependencies**: Missing packages in packages.txt
4. **Memory Issues**: Too many heavy packages loaded

## Performance Improvements

- **Faster Startup**: Lighter dependencies load faster
- **Lower Memory Usage**: NLTK uses less memory than spaCy
- **Better Reliability**: Fewer points of failure
- **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler dependency tree

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Test all functionality works as expected
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Consider further optimizations if needed

## Notes

- All NLP functionality is preserved with NLTK
- The app should work identically to the previous version
- Better compatibility with Streamlit Cloud's constraints
- Easier to maintain and update
