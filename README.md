# 🧠 About the Project – Cognora+

**Cognora+** is a GenAI-powered AI companion designed to support **daily cognitive and emotional wellness**, especially for the elderly and individuals at risk of isolation.

Through short daily conversations, Cognora+ listens (via voice or text), processes inputs using **Claude 3 Sonnet via Amazon Bedrock**, and analyzes emotional tone, cognitive health markers, and behavioral trends. It then generates a **personalized Cognora Score**, tracks changes over time, and **notifies caregivers** when signs of loneliness or decline are detected.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Cognitive decline and emotional isolation are often invisible until it's too late. Cognora+ bridges this gap with empathetic, intelligent interaction — proactively supporting mental wellness while reconnecting people with their loved ones.
